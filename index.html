          <ul>
            <li>
              What does the type of food discussed tell you about the piece?
            </li>
            <li>
              Are you meant to find the food delicious? Revolting? Something else?
            </li>
            <li>
              What is the food standing in for? Or is the Thanksgiving turkey <em>just</em> a Thanksgiving turkey?
            </li>

          <p>No? You sure?" one of my three older brothers asked me, blushing over his osseous prize.</p>

          <p>"Totally," I nodded from the kitchen sink, the gnawed cuticles of my fingers camouflaged by soap bubbles. "You should have it."</p>

          <p>And so ended this past year's version of the dance we do every time our Thanksgiving bird has been relieved of its meat. Bones and extra bits sit on the fat-slicked carving board, praying for an afterlife. I feign a wish to resurrect it into
            congee or some other extraordinary something. I "let" my brother and his wife (and their dog) take it to their home in downtown Baltimore, where theyâ€™ll make stock out of it and finish every last drop. </p>

            <br> I gotta find some grilled onions and a large side of fries

            "Well, of course," said Father, "not everyone is fond of soft-boiled eggs for breakfast. But there are other kinds of eggs. There are sunny-side-up and sunny-side-down eggs."</p>

          <p>"Yes," said Frances, "But sunny-side-up eggs lie on the plate and look up at you in a funny way and sunny-side-down eggs just lie on their stomach and <em>wait</em>."</p>
          <p>"What about scrambled eggs?" said Father.</p>
          <p>"Scrambled eggs fall off the fork and roll under the table," said Frances.</p>
          <p>"I think it is time for you to go to school now," said Mother.</p>
