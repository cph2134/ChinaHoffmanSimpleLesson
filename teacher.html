      <!--Intro-->
      <p>Good food writing is really just good writing that happens to include some kind of food. Sometimes it is the focus of the piece, some times it merely provides a rich atmosphere. Not everyone loves to cook or even to eat, but food has an emotional
        importance for almost everyone and writing about food it can be a powerful tool for learning to write. </p>
      <p>Ideally this lesson will be embedded in a challenging curriculum in which students work to become better readers and writers.</p>
      <p><span class="text-danger">Note:</span> Food, having too much or too little of it, or having the wrong kinds, can be an upsetting subject. Use caution in discussion and always consider the particular context of your students. </p>

  <!--Exercise 1 and 2, Discussion Question Guidance-->
  <h3>Notes on Exercise 1 and 2</h3>
  <p>You could use the discussion questions in Exercise 1 and 2 as an introduction to the lesson, a journalising exercise, or homework. I would suggest using one as the jumping off point for a discussion and another as a writing assignment, to give students
    multiple points of entry to the lesson. </p>
  <!--Exercise 3-->
  <h3>Notes on Exercise 3</h3>
  <p>If you think your students will take additional time to warm up to the personal writing exercise, consider using the Food Quiz below as a way to get students thinking and talking about food.</p>
  <!--Expansion ideas-->
  <h3>Expansion Ideas</h3>
  <p>If you are interested in expanding this lesson, students might enjoy attempting different styles of food writing, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> A restaurant review</li>
    <li> A family recipe</li>
    <li> An interview with someone who works in a restaurant or another food business</li>
  </ul>
